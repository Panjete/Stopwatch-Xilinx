# Stopwatch-Xilinx

I constructed a stopwatch using the LED displays and push button on the Basys 3 board.

Display format of the clock is (M:SS:T): minutes (M) on one LED display, seconds (SS) on two LED displayS and tenth of second (T) on one LED display.
In addition to this, the watch can be controlled via three push buttons:    
• start/continue     
• pause    
• reset
